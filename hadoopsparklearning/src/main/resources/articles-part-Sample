12	Anarchism         Anarchism is often defined as a political philosophy which holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.          The following sources cite anarchism as a political philosophy:      Slevin, Carl. "Anarchism." The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003.  However, others argue that while anti-statism is central, it is inadequate to define anarchism.  Therefore, they argue instead that anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organization in the conduct of human relations, including, but not only, the state system.            Proponents of anarchism, known as "anarchists", advocate stateless societies based on non-hierarchical free associations.     As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy.  There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.  Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.  Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications. Ostergaard, Geoffrey. "Anarchism". The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p.

Anarchism as a mass social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism, with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon  which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents  and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organizations.   Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression, supporting self-defense or non-violence (anarcho-pacifism),    George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements (1962)  while others have supported the use of some coercive measures, including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed, on the path to an anarchist society.  Etymology and terminology  The term   derives from the ancient Greek ἄναρχος, anarchos, meaning "without rulers",   from the prefix ἀν- (an-, "without") + ἀρχός (arkhos, "leader", from ἀρχή arkhē, "authority, sovereignty, realm, magistracy")  + -ισμός (-ismos, from the suffix -ιζειν, -izein "-izing"). "Anarchists" was the term adopted by Maximilien de Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of, though among these "anarchists" there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist, making the formal birth of anarchism the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s from France,  the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism  and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States;
